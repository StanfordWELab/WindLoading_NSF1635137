## Multi-fidelity machine learning
This directory contains the work on machine learning to leverage low and high-fidelity data:
  - **activeSubspaces**: preliminary data analysis using active subspaces and PCA 
  - **RMSpressure**: code relative to [1]
  - **designPressure**: work on predicting the design pressure of glazed panels given wind tunnel and RANS data
